Unity V2022.3.7.f1

I, Keany Rodriguez, am the sole creator and owner of Trick and Tussle. I did not copy or download anyone else's project code.

Player Control 
-------------------------
Use all 4 arrow keys to move the player around. 
Use the spacebar to jump

Basic Gameplay
-------------------------
You're a kid who got ditch because you want to go trick or treating instead of going to a party. But you're noticing the town is emptier than usual with the sound of groans in the distance. You soon find yourself surrounded by zombies! Try to survive as long as possible, kill as many zombies to score high and collect the boosters the zombies leave behind. Each time the booster bar is filled a new weapon is unlocked, two new weapons possible. Don't get eaten by Zombies! They lower your HP and you can die.


Game Mechanics
-------------------------
Features of the game include: 
- Main Menu : Start and Help section. Help will give you the agenda and the instructions to move your character.
- Score : Everytime you kill a Zombie, you get 10pts. 
- Health Bar : keeps track of your health (15hp). 
- Booster Bar : keeps track of the amount of boosters collected.
- Timer : Starts right after the "good luck" text and Zombies will then spawn. 
- As the game progresses, these features will increase or even decrease in certain cases. 
- Once you die, Your dead screen will show along with your time and a way to get back to the main menu. 

User Interface 
-------------------------
- Player : you'll be controlling a kid in a frog costume trying to avoid Zombies and collect boosters. 
- Zombies : you'll be trying to avoid them as they aim for your brain. Kill them, and they'll award you with 10pts automatically and spawn a booster at it's location of death. 
- Boosters: Spawned once Zombies die. Pizza, icecream, lollipops; collect enough and a new weapon will be unlocked. 
- Weapons: Apples will automatically shoot out of your Player. Boosters aid on unlocking new weapons. There are 2 additional weapons to unlock; Bananas and then Pumpkins. 
- All 3D assets were retrieved from Unity's store 

Sound Effects 
-------------------------
- No sound effects are included; kept it silent and unsettling 
- There's ominous background music that keeps you uneasy. 
- 2 particle effects are included: dirt particles when running and smoke paricles when the player dies. 
- Whenever you get hit by a Zombie, there will be a flashing red panel indicating a life was lost

Backlog

Features I would love to add if given more time: 
- Different enemies w/ different characteristics.
- Being able to choose the next weapon to unlock or upgrade. 

I loved creating this game and I hope you enjoy playing. This is version two and will continue to improve this game.
